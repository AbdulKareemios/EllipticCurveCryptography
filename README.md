##Definition:
ECC is a type of public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. It provides a method for secure key exchange, digital signatures, and encryption.

##General Concept:

ECC refers to a broad category of cryptographic algorithms and protocols that use elliptic curves. It encompasses various curves and their associated algorithms for tasks such as key exchange (e.g., ECDH), digital signatures (e.g., ECDSA), and encryption.

##Security:
ECC is known for providing high security with relatively small key sizes compared to other cryptographic methods like RSA. For example, a 256-bit key in ECC provides similar security to a 3072-bit RSA key.
